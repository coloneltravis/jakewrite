### Is your blog in need of a makeover?

### Are your visitors reporting that it is slow?

### Do you want people to see it on their phones and tablets?

CMS-backed blogs need a database which require an extra hop when loading and building in page. This extra hop can be avoided by pre-building all your content off-line using a static web generator. In addition to make the web site much faster to load, it will also be much more secure and protected against hacking threats.

Databases were never designed store and process large amounts of content such as required by a blog. Their purpose was to store data records for use in a data processing application such as stock control and employee management. When the web came along, databases were seen as an ideal way to store all the components of a web page so it can be built on-the-fly. Web applications could be built to provide a WYSIWYG interface to edit web pages to save the laborious task of typing HTML. Content could then be produced without needing to send editors on HTML courses.

As web design and development practices matured, it became possible to breakdown a web page into components such as styles, templates, content and Javascript. Build automation tools were also developed using new RAD programming languages like Ruby, Python and NodeJs. These gave birth to the static web generator which could pull in all raw web components to produce a complete web site ready to upload to a host.

I can supercharge your blog by migrating it from a CMS to a static web site using a static site generator like [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com), [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io) or [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com).

### Static web sites are both the past and future of the web.


The advantages of a static web site provide:-

  - Faster response times
  - Less vulnerabilities for hackers to exploit
  - All posts and pages can be version-controlled using a repository like GitHub
  - Better management of multiple content editors and reviewers
  - Quick disaster recovery of site by uploading to alternate hosting provider
  - Single-source/Multiple output - content created once for output in different formats
    e.g. web, PDF, EPUB and many more.
