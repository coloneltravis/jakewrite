Hello and welcome to my new writing blog!

What are you thinking? Not another writing blog!  There are so many blogs from writers on the Internet, but what makes each one different. Every writer has developed their own craft and style from a unique set of experiences. Some have a background in the creative arts whilst some will have come from more traditional 9-5 office job backgrounds. I fall into the latter.

I have had an active imagination from an early age.  I am constantly creating stories in my head, but would like to translate my thoughts into the words.  I have been on several different creative writing classes which have showed be the different options for a writer.  Writing classes offer some good advice, but at the end of the day, only practice is going to allow a writer to find their own personal style.  It's important to listen to advice and critique but remember that you may not be everyone's cup of tea!

With a background as a software developer, the best place for me to start my journey into the writing world is technical writing. I love learning how new software works and keeping updated with the latest concepts. Expect to see reviews, tutorials, hints and tips and plenty more useful articles.
